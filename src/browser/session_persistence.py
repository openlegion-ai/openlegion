"""Phase 10 §20 — per-agent BrowserContext storage-state persistence.

Without persistence the agent loses cookies, ``localStorage``,
``sessionStorage``, and IndexedDB on container restart or worker
reschedule. Any workflow that requires staying logged in for more
than one task either re-authenticates (slow, often blocked by 2FA /
captcha) or stops working entirely.

This module captures Playwright's ``BrowserContext.storage_state()``
to a per-agent JSON sidecar at ``data/sessions/<agent_id>.json``,
restores it on next launch, and exposes an operator-controlled clear
path. Lifecycle wiring lives in ``src/browser/service.py``; the flag
gate lives in ``src/browser/flags.py``.

──────────────── Privacy posture ────────────────

The sidecars contain session tokens (cookies + ``localStorage``) that,
if leaked, allow account takeover on whatever site the agent was logged
into. Three controls keep the blast radius small:

1. **Default-off.** ``BROWSER_SESSION_PERSISTENCE_ENABLED`` defaults
   to ``False``. Operators must opt in deliberately.
2. **chmod 0o600.** Files are written with owner-only read/write
   from the moment they exist on disk — there is NO world-readable
   window between create and chmod. This matches the captcha-cost
   counter's posture and the ``.agent.env`` file's chmod.
3. **No domain leakage.** The dashboard summary endpoint returns
   counts only — no cookie values, no origin names. Audit events
   sent to the EventBus carry the same shape (count + bool, no
   origins). Operators have to inspect the JSON file directly to
   see specific origins, and that file is chmod 0600.

──────────────── Why a separate module ────────────────

We could inline this into ``service.py``, but the captcha-cost counter
sets the precedent that persistence concerns get their own module
(easier to test in isolation; clearer surface for the lifecycle
hook). The atomic-write protocol below is adapted from
``captcha_cost_counter.snapshot`` — same approach (open with mode
``0o600``, fsync, ``os.replace``), different payload.

──────────────── On-disk schema ────────────────

::

    {
      "version": 1,
      "saved_at": <epoch seconds>,
      "storage_state": {
          "cookies": [...],
          "origins": [{"origin": "...", "localStorage": [...]}, ...]
      }
    }

``version`` is checked on restore. Future schema bumps fall through
to a fresh state (with a warning log) so an older browser-service
build can't crash by reading a newer file. Operators own rotation /
expiry — there is no time-based expiry built in. A file produced
six months ago restores fine; whether the embedded session tokens
are still valid is a question for the upstream site.

    ``context`` is duck-typed as a Playwright ``BrowserContext``; only
    ``storage_state()`` is called. Returns ``True`` on success;
    ``False`` on any failure (logged).

    The shutdown path must NOT crash because session persistence
    failed — same posture as the captcha-cost counter snapshot
    (a noisy log + ``False`` is the contract). A late-arriving
    ``Shutdown`` from systemd or Docker is plenty common; raising
    here would orphan the browser process and leak state.

    Atomic-write protocol (same as captcha_cost_counter):

      1. ``os.open`` the tmp file with ``O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC``
         and **mode 0o600** so there is no world-readable window
         before the explicit chmod. Sensitive data: cookies +
         ``localStorage`` values are session credentials.
      2. Write the JSON payload, ``flush()``, ``fsync()``.
      3. ``os.replace(tmp, path)`` — atomic rename.
      4. Re-``chmod`` the destination to 0o600. Some filesystems
         preserve the destination's prior mode across ``replace``;
         the explicit chmod after replace is belt-and-suspenders so
         operators can rely on the mode regardless of whether the
